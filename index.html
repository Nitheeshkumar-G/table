    <py>The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph. <br>A paragraph always starts on a new line, <br>and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.</py>    
    <py><b>A paragraph</b> is a series of <strong>sentences</strong> that are <i>organized</i> and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. Almost every <em>piece </em>of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.<mark> This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end,</mark>mark and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.

       <small> Paragraphs can contain </small>many different kinds of information. A paragraph could <del>contain </del>a series <ins>and</ins> brief <sub>examples or a single</sub> long <sup>illustration of a general point</sup>. <u>It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories;</u> or describe causes and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One of the most important of these is a topic sentence.
